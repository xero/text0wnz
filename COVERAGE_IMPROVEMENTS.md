## Modules Still Below 60%

These modules require significant additional work:

### Close to 60%
- **ui.js**: 57.98% (needs ~2% more)
- **server.js**: 55.4% (needs ~5% more)

### Moderate Coverage Needed
- **network.js**: 47.53% (needs ~13% more)
- **font.js**: 46.77% (needs ~14% more)

### Significant Coverage Needed
- **canvas.js**: 43.1% (needs ~17% more)
- **freehand_tools.js**: 42.35% (needs ~18% more)
- **file.js**: 41.39% (needs ~19% more)
- **keyboard.js**: 41.18% (needs ~19% more)

### Special Cases
- **text0wnz.js (server)**: 22.17%
  - Extensive integration testing would be needed
  - Many functions require live server environment
  
- **fileio.js (server)**: 8.67%
  - Algorithm tests added (29 tests)
  - Low coverage is expected due to fs dependencies
  - Better covered through E2E tests
  
- **main.js (client)**: 17.51%
  - Acknowledged as difficult to test in unit tests
  - Heavy DOM integration requires E2E testing

## Testing Challenges Identified

### 1. File System Dependencies
Modules like `fileio.js` and `text0wnz.js` have extensive file system operations that are difficult to mock properly in unit tests. The approach taken was to:
- Test algorithms and data structures in isolation
- Validate business logic without file I/O
- Rely on E2E tests for integration scenarios

### 2. DOM Integration
Modules like `main.js`, `canvas.js`, and parts of `ui.js` have deep DOM integration that requires:
- Complex mocking setup
- Browser environment simulation
- Better coverage through E2E tests with Playwright

### 3. WebSocket Integration
Real-time collaboration features in `text0wnz.js` and `websockets.js` require:
- Live server environment
- Multiple connected clients
- Message sequencing and timing
- Better suited for integration tests

### 4. Canvas Rendering
The `canvas.js` module has complex rendering logic that would benefit from:
- Visual regression testing
- E2E tests with actual canvas rendering
- Pixel-level validation

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

### High Priority (to reach 60%)
1. **ui.js** (57.98% → 60%+)
   - Add tests for `createGrid` implementation
   - Add tests for `createToolPreview` implementation
   - Add tests for `createFontSelect` implementation
   - ~20-30 additional tests needed

2. **server.js** (55.4% → 60%+)
   - Mock Express app more comprehensively
   - Test middleware registration
   - Test signal handler execution
   - ~10-15 additional tests needed

### Medium Priority
3. **network.js** (47.53% → 60%+)
   - Mock WebSocket connections
   - Test message handlers
   - Test reconnection logic
   - ~40-50 additional tests needed

4. **font.js** (46.77% → 60%+)
   - Test font loading edge cases
   - Test error handling paths
   - Test font rendering variations
   - ~30-40 additional tests needed

### Lower Priority (require significant effort)
5. **canvas.js**, **file.js**, **keyboard.js**, **freehand_tools.js**
   - Each needs 60-100 additional tests
   - Consider E2E testing for complex interactions
   - Focus on critical paths first

### Integration Testing
6. **text0wnz.js** and **fileio.js**
   - Create integration test suite
   - Use temporary files for testing
   - Mock file system when possible
   - Consider containerized testing

## Documentation Updates

### READMEs Updated
- ✅ `tests/unit/README.md` - Updated with latest coverage stats and module categorization
- ✅ `tests/dom/README.md` - Updated with current test counts and notes

### Coverage Tracking
- All modules now categorized by coverage level
- Clear identification of modules needing improvement
- Notes on testing challenges and limitations

## Testing Best Practices Applied

1. **Algorithm-Focused Testing**: For modules with external dependencies, test the algorithms and business logic in isolation
2. **Edge Case Coverage**: Added comprehensive edge case tests (empty data, invalid input, boundary conditions)
3. **Error Path Testing**: Ensured error handling paths are tested
4. **Mock Strategy**: Used appropriate mocking for external dependencies
5. **Test Organization**: Grouped related tests with clear describe blocks
6. **Documentation**: Clear test names and comments explaining what is being tested

## Conclusion

While the overall coverage improvement was modest (+0.47%), significant progress was made in specific areas:
- **toolbar.js** achieved 95.58% coverage (+39.7%)
- Added 46 new tests across multiple modules
- Identified and documented testing challenges
- Created clear roadmap for future improvements

The project now has:
- 13 modules at ≥60% coverage
- Comprehensive algorithm testing for complex modules
- Clear documentation of testing challenges
- Actionable recommendations for future work

To achieve 60%+ coverage across all modules, an estimated 200-300 additional tests would be needed, with a focus on the modules closest to the target threshold.
