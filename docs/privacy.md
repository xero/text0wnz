# Privacy Policy

## Overview

The makers of the [teXt0wnz](https://github.com/xero/teXt0wnz) application value your privacy and are committed to transparency about how your data is handled.

## Data Storage and Usage

### Local Storage

This application uses your device’s local storage to save the following information:
- **CANVAS_DATA**: The raw drawing data for your current artwork.
- **FONT_NAME**, **PALETTE_COLORS**, **ICE_COLORS**, **LETTER_SPACING**, **XBIN_FONT_DATA**: Editor font and configuration settings to ensure a consistent experience.

No personal data is collected or stored unless you voluntarily include it in your artwork’s "[sauce](sauce-format.md)" metadata. All data remains on your device and is never unknowingly transferred; only files you explicitly choose to save or export leave your device.

### Cookies and Tracking

We do **not** use cookies, tracking technologies, or similar mechanisms.

## Server-side Collaboration Mode

When you opt into collaboration mode, the following data is temporarily processed by the server to enable real-time collaboration:

- **SESSION_ID**: A randomly generated session token to identify your collaborative session.
- **HANDLE**: Your chat handle or name. Defaults to "anonymous" until you join a collaboration session and change the value.
- **SEND_NOTIFICATION**: A boolean value for chat notification preferences. Defaults to 0 (off) until you enable it.
- **CANVAS_DATA**: The shared raw drawing data for the collaborative session.
- **FONT_NAME**, **PALETTE_COLORS**, **ICE_COLORS**, **LETTER_SPACING**, **XBIN_FONT_DATA**: Editor font and configuration settings shared for consistent rendering.

**Data Handling Details:**
- By default, no IP addresses or other persistent identifiers are logged.
- You have full control over what information is shared; chat handle and notification settings are opt-in and default to anonymous and off.

**Important Notice:**
While the default server does not log IP addresses or other persistent identifiers, we cannot control the policies and or modifications of other system administrators running our free software.
Whenever connecting to a collaboration server not operated by us, **assume your IP address and other information may be logged**. Please review the privacy policy of any third-party server you connect to.

## User Control

- You have full control over your data.
- Only files you choose to save or export are transferred from your device.

## Updates

This privacy policy may be updated in the future. Any changes will be reflected here.
