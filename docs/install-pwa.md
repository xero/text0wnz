# Progressive Web App (PWA) Install Instructions by Platform

This document provides step-by-step instructions for installing a Progressive Web App (PWA), like **teXt0wnz** across major platforms and browsers. PWAs offer app-like experiences directly from your browser, with offline support and native-like features.

3. Click the "Install" icon.
4. Confirm installation in the prompt.
5. The app will open in its own window and be accessible from your desktop or app launcher.

2. Click the "Share" button in the Safari toolbar.
3. Select "Add to Home Screen."
4. The PWA will be added to your Launchpad and can be opened like a native app.
