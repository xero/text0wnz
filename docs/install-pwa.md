## 3. Desktop Firefox

**Steps:**

1. Firefox does not natively support PWA installation as a standalone app on desktop.
2. You can use a third-party extension like [PWAs-For-FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pwas-for-firefox/)
3. Alternatively, use Chrome or Edge for PWA installation on desktop.
