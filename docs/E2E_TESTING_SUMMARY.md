## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run bake
   ```

2. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

### Execute Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific browser
npx playwright test --project=Chrome
npx playwright test --project=Firefox
npx playwright test --project=WebKit

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/canvas.spec.js

# Run in UI mode (interactive)
npx playwright test --ui

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
npx playwright test --headed

# Debug tests
npx playwright test --debug
```

### View Results

```bash
# View HTML report
npx playwright show-report tests/results/playwright-report
```

## CI/CD Integration

The tests are ready for CI/CD integration. Example GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci

- name: Install Playwright browsers
  run: npx playwright install --with-deps

- name: Build application
  run: npm run bake

- name: Run E2E tests
  run: npm run test:e2e

- name: Upload test results
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: tests/results/playwright-report/
```

## Next Steps

1. **Install browsers**: Run `npx playwright install` to download test browsers
2. **Run tests locally**: Verify all tests pass in your environment
3. **Add to CI/CD**: Integrate tests into automated pipeline
4. **Extend coverage**: Add more tests for specific edge cases or new features
5. **Visual regression**: Consider adding screenshot comparison tests
6. **Performance tests**: Add tests to measure load times and rendering performance

## Benefits

- **Automated testing**: Catch regressions before deployment
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Tests run on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- **User-focused**: Tests validate actual user workflows
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of features
- **Confidence**: Deploy with confidence knowing features work
- **Maintenance**: Easy to add new tests following established patterns

## Notes

- Tests are designed to work in both local and collaboration modes
- Gracefully handle missing optional features
- Use flexible selectors to survive UI changes
- Include appropriate waits for async operations
- Well-organized by feature area
- Comprehensive documentation for future developers
