### After
- **Total Test Files:** 35 (+4 new files)
- **Total Tests:** 790 (+66 tests, +9.1% increase)
- **websocket.js Coverage:** 96.4% (+96.4%)

### Overall Coverage

- **Server modules:** 41.36% statement coverage
- **Overall:** 47.24% statement coverage

## Test Organization

### Unit Tests
- **Location:** `tests/unit/`
- **New Files:**
  - `websocket.test.js` - WebSocket worker module tests
  - `magicNumbers.test.js` - Application constants validation

### E2E Tests
- **Location:** `tests/e2e/`
- **New Files:**
  - `undo-redo.spec.js` - Advanced undo/redo operations
  - `clipboard.spec.js` - Advanced clipboard operations

## Quality Assurance

All tests have been:
- ✅ Linted with ESLint (no errors)
- ✅ Formatted with Prettier
- ✅ Run and verified passing
- ✅ Integrated with existing test infrastructure
- ✅ Following project testing patterns and conventions

## Running the New Tests

### All Unit Tests
```bash
bun test:unit
```

### Specific Unit Tests
```bash
npx vitest tests/unit/websocket.test.js
npx vitest tests/unit/magicNumbers.test.js
```

### All E2E Tests
```bash
bun test:e2e
```

### Specific E2E Tests
```bash
bunx playwright test tests/e2e/undo-redo.spec.js
bunx playwright test tests/e2e/clipboard.spec.js
```

### New Tests Only
```bash
# Unit tests for new modules
npx vitest tests/unit/websocket.test.js tests/unit/magicNumbers.test.js

# New E2E tests
bunx playwright test tests/e2e/undo-redo.spec.js tests/e2e/clipboard.spec.js
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability:** Critical websocket module now has 96.4% test coverage, reducing risk of collaboration feature regressions

2. **Better Constant Validation:** magicNumbers module has explicit validation tests ensuring application constants remain correct

3. **Enhanced User Flow Testing:** New E2E tests cover complex user workflows like advanced undo/redo sequences and clipboard operations with formatting

4. **Regression Prevention:** Comprehensive tests prevent future changes from breaking existing functionality

5. **Documentation:** Tests serve as living documentation of expected behavior

6. **CI/CD Confidence:** Higher test coverage provides greater confidence in automated deployments

## Future Testing Opportunities

While this PR significantly improves test coverage, additional testing could be added for:
- **main.js** (currently 17.51% coverage) - Application initialization
- **file.js** (currently 41.39% coverage) - File I/O operations  
- **text0wnz.js** (currently 22.17% coverage) - Server collaboration engine
- Additional collaboration scenarios in E2E tests
- Performance and stress testing
- Accessibility testing with screen readers

## Conclusion

This test suite addition represents a **9.1% increase** in overall test count with targeted improvements to critical untested modules. The websocket module went from **0% to 96.4% coverage**, significantly reducing risk in the collaboration features. The new E2E tests cover advanced user workflows that were previously only manually testable.
